**Bash Script For Generating A Multiplication Table**:<br>

**OBJECTIVE**: To create a **Bash Script** that generate multiplication table for a number entered by the user.<br>
**DESCRIPTION**: This script prompt the user to enter a number then ask if they want a full or partial multiplication table from 1 to 10 within a specific range base on the user's choice. If they choose partial table, this script prompt them from the start and end of the range.<br>
I implement the use of **Loop** to generate the multiplication table. And also use *if-else* statement to handle the conditional logic based on user's choice (full vs partial table and valid range input).
